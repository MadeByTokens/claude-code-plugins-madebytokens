# /tdd-loop Command

When the user runs `/tdd-loop "<requirement>" [options]` or `/tdd-loop --requirement-file <path> [options]`, follow these instructions:

## Step 1: Parse User Input

Extract from the command:
- **requirement** (optional): The user's feature description as inline text
- **--requirement-file** (optional): Path to a markdown file containing the requirement
- **--max-iterations** (optional, default: 15): Maximum loop iterations
- **--mutation-threshold** (optional, default: 0.8): Required mutation score (0.0-1.0)
- **--test-scope** (optional, default: "unit"): Test scope (unit/integration/both)
- **--language** (optional, default: auto-detect): Target language

**Requirement source rules:**
- At least one of: inline requirement OR `--requirement-file` must be provided
- If neither is provided, display error: "⚠️ No requirement specified. Provide a quoted requirement or use --requirement-file <path>." and STOP
- Both can be used together: file content becomes the main requirement, inline text is appended as additional notes

**If `--requirement-file` is specified:**
1. Display: "📄 Loading requirement from: <filepath>"
2. Check if the file exists using the Read tool
3. **If the file does not exist or cannot be read:**
   - Display error: "❌ File not found: <filepath>"
   - Display: "Please check the path and try again."
   - STOP - do not continue
4. Read the file content
5. **If the file is empty:**
   - Display error: "❌ Requirement file is empty: <filepath>"
   - STOP - do not continue
6. Display: "✅ Requirement loaded (<N> characters)"

**Combining file and inline requirements:**
If BOTH `--requirement-file` AND inline text are provided, combine them as follows:

```
<file content>

---
**Additional Notes:**
<inline text>
```

Display: "📝 Added inline notes to requirement"

## Step 2: Check for Existing Loop

**IMPORTANT:** First, provide feedback that you're checking:
- Display: "🔍 Checking for existing TDD loops..."

Read `.tdd-state.json` if it exists. If `active: true`:
- Display: "⚠️  An active TDD loop already exists. Use `/cancel-tdd` to cancel it first, or `/tdd-status` to check its status."
- STOP - do not continue.

If no active loop, display: "✅ No active loops found. Initializing new TDD loop..."

## Step 3: Initialize Loop State

Create `.tdd-state.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "iteration": 1,
  "phase": "WRITING_TESTS",
  "requirement": "<user's requirement text>",
  "maxIterations": <parsed or 15>,
  "mutationThreshold": <parsed or 0.8>,
  "testScope": "<parsed or 'unit'>",
  "language": "<parsed or null>",
  "testFiles": {},
  "implFiles": {},
  "lastVerdict": null,
  "lastFeedback": {
    "test_writer": null,
    "code_writer": null
  },
  "mutationScore": null,
  "mutationSurvivors": [],
  "history": [],
  "startedAt": "<current ISO timestamp>"
}
```

**After creating the state file, display:**
"✅ State file created: .tdd-state.json"

## Step 4: Display Loop Initialization

Output:

```
🎭 **Bon Cop Bad Cop - Adversarial TDD Loop**

✓ Loop initialized
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Requirement: <requirement>
Max Iterations: <maxIterations>
Mutation Threshold: <mutationThreshold * 100>%
Test Scope: <testScope>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 1: Test Writer creates comprehensive tests
Phase 2: Code Writer implements based on tests only
Phase 3: Reviewer validates and issues verdict

Loop will continue until ALL_PASS or max iterations reached.
Use /tdd-status to check progress, /cancel-tdd to stop.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Step 5: Run the TDD Loop

**CRITICAL:** You must orchestrate the loop yourself by invoking agents sequentially using the Task tool. Do NOT rely on any external hooks or automation.

### Loop Algorithm

```
while iteration <= maxIterations:
    1. Invoke test-writer agent (if phase is WRITING_TESTS or verdict is WEAK_TESTS)
    2. Wait for test-writer to complete, update state
    3. Invoke code-writer agent (if phase is WRITING_CODE or verdict is WEAK_CODE)
    4. Wait for code-writer to complete, update state
    5. Invoke reviewer agent
    6. Check verdict:
       - ALL_PASS: Exit loop successfully
       - WEAK_TESTS: Increment iteration, go to step 1
       - WEAK_CODE: Increment iteration, go to step 3
    7. Increment iteration
```

### Phase 1: Test Writer

Use the **Task tool** with `subagent_type: "bon-cop-bad-cop:test-writer"` to invoke the test-writer agent.

**Prompt for test-writer:**
```
You are the Test Writer in iteration <iteration> of the Bon Cop Bad Cop TDD loop.

**Requirement:** <requirement from state>
**Test Scope:** <testScope>

Your task:
1. Create comprehensive test files for this requirement
2. Include anti-cheating tests (random values, property-based tests)
3. Include edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Write tests in the appropriate language (detect from project or use Python)

When done:
1. Save your test file(s) to disk (e.g., test_<name>.py)
2. Update .tdd-state.json:
   - Set `testFiles` to include your test files (key: filename, value: content)
   - Set `phase` to "WRITING_CODE"

<If there's feedback from previous iteration>
**Previous feedback:** <lastFeedback.test_writer>
**Mutation survivors to address:** <mutationSurvivors>
</If>
```

After test-writer completes, read `.tdd-state.json` to confirm state was updated.

### Phase 2: Code Writer

**Before invoking code-writer:** Strip comments from test files to prevent information leakage:
```bash
python tools/strip_comments.py <test_file> <stripped_test_file>
```
Pass the stripped test files to the code-writer, not the originals.

Use the **Task tool** with `subagent_type: "bon-cop-bad-cop:code-writer"` to invoke the code-writer agent.

**Prompt for code-writer:**
```
You are the Code Writer in iteration <iteration> of the Bon Cop Bad Cop TDD loop.

**IMPORTANT:** You do NOT see the original requirement. You must implement based ONLY on the tests.

**Test files to implement against:**
<List test files from state>

Your task:
1. Read the test files (focus on what they test, not comments)
2. Implement the minimal code to pass ALL tests
3. Do NOT cheat (no hardcoded values, no lookup tables)

When done:
1. Save your implementation file(s) to disk
2. Update .tdd-state.json:
   - Set `implFiles` to include your implementation files
   - Set `phase` to "REVIEWING"

<If there's feedback from previous iteration>
**Previous feedback:** <lastFeedback.code_writer>
</If>
```

After code-writer completes, read `.tdd-state.json` to confirm state was updated.

### Phase 3: Reviewer

Use the **Task tool** with `subagent_type: "bon-cop-bad-cop:reviewer"` to invoke the reviewer agent.

**Prompt for reviewer:**
```
You are the Reviewer in iteration <iteration> of the Bon Cop Bad Cop TDD loop.

**Original Requirement:** <requirement>
**Mutation Threshold:** <mutationThreshold>

**Test files:** <list from testFiles>
**Implementation files:** <list from implFiles>

Your task:
1. Run the tests and check they pass
2. Check for flaky tests (run multiple times if needed)
3. Check for cheating in implementation (hardcoded values, lookup tables)
4. Run mutation testing if available
5. Issue a verdict

When done, update .tdd-state.json:
- Set `lastVerdict` to one of: "ALL_PASS", "WEAK_TESTS", "WEAK_CODE"
- Set `lastFeedback.test_writer` if verdict is WEAK_TESTS (what to improve)
- Set `lastFeedback.code_writer` if verdict is WEAK_CODE (what to fix)
- Set `mutationScore` if mutation testing was run
- Set `mutationSurvivors` if there are surviving mutants
- Set `phase` to "COMPLETE" if ALL_PASS, otherwise "WRITING_TESTS" or "WRITING_CODE"
```

After reviewer completes, read `.tdd-state.json` and check the verdict.

## Step 6: Handle Loop Completion

### On ALL_PASS:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎉 ALL PASS - TDD Loop Complete!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Completed in <iteration> iteration(s)

Generated files:
Tests: <list test files>
Implementation: <list impl files>
Mutation Score: <score>%

The code has been validated against comprehensive tests.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Update state: `active: false`, `stoppedReason: "all_pass"`, `completedAt: <timestamp>`

### On Max Iterations Reached:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  Max iterations (<maxIterations>) reached
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The agents couldn't converge to ALL_PASS within the iteration limit.
Last verdict: <lastVerdict>

Review the generated files and consider:
- Simplifying the requirement
- Increasing max iterations
- Reviewing feedback from last iteration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Update state: `active: false`, `stoppedReason: "max_iterations"`, `completedAt: <timestamp>`

## Progress Updates

Between each agent invocation, display progress:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎭 Iteration <n>/<max> - Phase: <phase>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Error Handling

If any agent fails or state becomes corrupted:
1. Display error message
2. Set `active: false` and `stoppedReason: "error"`
3. Suggest running `/tdd-status` or `/cancel-tdd`
